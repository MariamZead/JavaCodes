	Abstract class : 
	    - Must be declared with an abstract keyword
      - Cannot be instantiated (cannot create object directly by using new keyword) "AbstractClass c1 = new ConcreteClass();"
      - Can be used as datatype
      - Once there is Abstract class, you have to inherit it from Concrete class (to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.)
      - Can have abstract method and non-abstract methods
      - Can have its own constructor and static and final methods
      - There is no abstract variable only classes and methods 
      - Private , final , Static methods , Constructor cannot have Abstract keyword 
      
	Abstract Methods :       
  	    - Defines without implementations (cannot have body) 
        - The implementations happens in ConcreteClass
        - Can't be static
      
	Concrete class :
    	    -  Must be declared with an extends keyword (inheritance) 
          -  Can be instantiated (create object directly) by using new keyword
          - Implements all the abstract methods of abstract class (overridden)
          - Can be declared as final
